# MEDICAL EVENTS MIS API

**Version: 9.13.0**

Environment: **DEMO**

> Read more about eHealth API Manifest [here](https://ehealthapimanifest.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/interacting-with-api)

All the medical data, stored in eHealth, belongs to the patient and must be properly protected. eHealth provides several mechanisms to secure patient's data and limitate access.

1. Only authenticated user with appropriate scope can access medical data
List of scopes available for the specific user role can be recieved using [/roles endpoint](https://ehealthmisapi1.docs.apiary.io/#reference/public.-medical-service-provider-integration-layer/roles/list-roles) [wiki: Scopes data model](https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EH/pages/583404101/Scopes+model)
2. Access to Patient Medical Data is driven by Attribute-based access control(ABAC). Rules [https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EH/pages/17049388207/ABAC+rules+EN]
3. Patient is able to grant access to specific episode(s) for specific users. User with this approval can view episode details and its nested entities
4. Post methods are async

## About ABAC
Some routes in eHealth are managed not only by scope-based  model, but Atribute Bаsed Access Control (ABAC) model.
Routes, that responds with lists, are not designed to cut responses automatically(show only allowed items). In order to access list, user should specify filters (search params) to cut entities that are not allowed by ABAC rules. 
For example,
- to access this route:
 `/patient/{patient_id}/conditions`
user should have approval on ALL patients medical data, otherwise the response will be 403.
- But, by specifinig filters, user can access requested data, if one of the ABAC rules returns true:
 `/patient/{patient_id}/conditions?episode_context={episode_1}`

Here you can find the list of current [rules](https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EH/pages/17049388207/ABAC+rules+EN).

## About Forbidden Groups filtration
Some routes in eHealth are managed not only by scope-based  model and ABAC rules, but Forbidden Groups model.

After successfull access with ABAC response will be filtered according to [Medical Events filtration by Forbidden groups](https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EH/pages/5056954517/Medical+Events+filtration+by+Forbidden+groups+EN)

# Group Medical Events
Medical events API is a set of web services designed to provide methods of communication between eHealth Medical Data Storage and medical information systems (MIS).
Medical events API is based on the international framework for exchanging digital health records - FHIR( Release 3 (STU)). Most of  major resources, data types, data structures and their way of interpretation are inherited from FHIR. However, there are minor сhanges described in Apiary.
To find out more about business logic behind the API read [this](https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EH/pages/583402836/Medical+Events+API).

### Cancel Care Plan [PATCH /api/patients/{patient_id}/care_plans/{id}/actions/cancel]

This method must be used to cancel of existing patient's Care plan. Method receives signed message (pkcs7) that consists of signed content, digital signature and signer public key. All signature fields will be validated (including signer certificate authority)

**Important**
1. Signed content of care plan must be equal to care plan stored in DB. See *Get Care plan by ID*
2. Activities should not be presented in signed content. 
3. $.status_reason must be added to signed content
