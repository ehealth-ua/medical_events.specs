# eHealth MIS Medical Events API

Environment: **PREPROD,PROD**

> Read more about eHealth API Manifest [here](https://ehealthapimanifest.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/interacting-with-api)

Test All the medical data, stored in eHealth, belongs to the patient and must be properly protected. eHealth provides several mechanisms to secure patient's data and restrict access.

1. Only authenticated user with appropriate scope can access medical data.
List of scopes available for the specific user role can be recieved using [/roles endpoint](https://ehealthmisapi1.docs.apiary.io/#reference/public.-medical-service-provider-integration-layer/roles/list-roles) [wiki: Scopes data model](https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EH/pages/583404101/Scopes+model)
2. Access to Patient Medical Data is driven by Attribute-based access control(ABAC). Rules [https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EH/pages/17049388207/ABAC+rules+EN]
3. Patient is able to grant access to specific episode(s) for specific users. User with this approval can view episode details and its nested entities
4. Post methods are async

The table below lists the actual API endpoints for all eHealth environments:

## About ABAC
Some routes in eHealth are managed not only by scope-based  model, but Atribute Bаsed Access Control (ABAC) model.
Routes, that responds with lists, are not designed to cut responses automatically(show only allowed items). In order to access list, user should specify filters (search params) to cut entities that are not allowed by ABAC rules. 
For example,
- to access this route:
 `/patient/{patient_id}/conditions`
user should have approval on ALL patients medical data, otherwise the response will be 403.
- But, by specifinig filters, user can access requested data, if one of the ABAC rules returns true:
 `/patient/{patient_id}/conditions?episode_context={episode_1}`

Here you can find the list of current [rules](https://github.com/edenlabllc/ehealth.abac.api/blob/develop/apps/rules/priv/features/medical_events.feature).
# Group Medical Events
Medical events API is a set of web services designed to provide methods of communication between eHealth Medical Data Storage and medical information systems (MIS).
Medical events API is based on the international framework for exchanging digital health records - FHIR( Release 3 (STU)). Most of  major resources, data types, data structures and their way of interpretation are inherited from FHIR. However, there are minor сhanges described in Apiary.
To find out more about business logic behind the API read [this](https://e-health-ua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EH/pages/583402836/Medical+Events+API).

### Complete Care Plan Activity [PATCH /api/patients/{patient_id}/care_plans/{care_plan_id}/activities/{id}/actions/complete]

This method must be used to complete of existing activity from patient's Care plan.

It can be processed in both sync and async methods depends on Server decision.
Depends on processing method Server might answer with:
http code| processing method | Client recommendations
--|--|--
201 | sync | use payload from response
202 | async: **default** method | use [Get job details](https://ehealthmedicaleventsapi.docs.apiary.io/#reference/medical-events/encounter-data-package/get-async-job-processing-details) to get processing result. Response payload will be returned in the job details
